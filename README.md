# Deep-Learning-Specialization---Code

This Deep Learning Specialization course is offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) (through Coursera's platform). The specialization was developed to teach the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. In this specilization I have learn't about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. I have worked on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. This has given the opportunity to master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry while practicing these ideas in Python and TensorlFlow.

I have created this GitHub repo to document my progress throughout this specialization, specifically the coding assignments and hands on projects I have completed during each course.

This specilization has been broken down into 5 courses, I have attached the goals of each course below to highlight what I have personally learn't and also for anyone interested taking the courses themselves:

### Course 1 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning 
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, you will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications

### Course 2 - Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
- Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications
- Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking
- Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence
- Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
- Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow 

### Course 3 - Structuring Machine Learning Projects
Much of this content has never been taught elsewhere, and is drawn from [Andrew Ng's](https://hai.stanford.edu/people/andrew-ng) experience building and shipping many deep learning products. This course also has two "flight simulators" that let you practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. This provides "industry experience" that you might otherwise get only after years of ML work experience. 
- Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error. 
- Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance. 
- Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning I've seen teams waste months or years through not understanding the principles taught in this course.

### Course 4 - Convolutional Neural Networks
- Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks  
- Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks
- Know to use neural style transfer to generate art
- Be able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data

### Course 5 - Sequence Models
- Understand how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs. 
- Be able to apply sequence models to natural language problems, including text synthesis. 
- Be able to apply sequence models to audio applications, including speech recognition and music synthesis. 
- This is the fifth and final course of the Deep Learning Specialization. deeplearning.ai is also partnering with the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) in Course 5, Sequence Models, to provide a programming assignment on Machine Translation with deep learning. Students will have the opportunity to build a deep learning project with cutting-edge, industry-relevant content.
